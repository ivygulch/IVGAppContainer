Router
- add error/throws/something when adding presenter or segment with identifier that already exists
- ? verify that presenter exists when adding segment
- better error handing/logging
- add tests for appendRoute
- make presenters/segments reversable (e.g. reversing a push does pop, custom ones, etc)

optional:
- allow presentedViewController to be a list (e.g. all tabs at once, master/detail, vc stack)
